# Ferris CMS

A simple, high(hopefully)-performant CMS that uses plain Markdown files

## What?
When a markdown page is created in ```dist/```, it will automatically be assigned to a http folder at the root of the URL. For example, the file ```dist/important_document.md``` would have the URL of ```.../important_document```

## Features
- Instant updates to file structure and access

## TODO
- Change ending from a folder to a .md or .html
- Add folder support for index.md files in any folder
